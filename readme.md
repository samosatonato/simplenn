# Quickstart

Initialize workbench using:
```python
import miniflow as mf

workbench = mf.MiniFlowWorkbench()
```

add layers and activation functions, e.g.:
```python
workbench.add
```

add loss function, optimizer and hyperparameter tuner, e.g.:
```python
workbench.add
workbench.add
workbench.add
```

specify evaluation metrics, e.g.:
```python
workbench.add
```

supply training and testing datasets, e.g.:
```python
# pythonlist[ndarray(sample_size, input_dim), ndarray(sample_size, output_dim)]
workbench.add(training_dataset)
workbench.add(testing_dataset)
```

build and run the resulting machinery:
```python
workbench.build()
workbench.run()
```

# MiniFlow

MiniFlow is a simple, self-contained (except for *numpy* and *matplotlib* libraries) package created for a school project.

It is used to construct, train and evaluate a simple feedforward neural network using basic gradient descent-based parameter optimizers.

This project was inspired by many existing and popular machine learning libraries and few similarities are not unexpected.

**Declaration of originality:**

*No code in this project has been explicitly reused, artificially generated or plagiarized.*

**Declaration on generative artificial intelligence:**

*A LLM chat API has been used to improve on quality, speed of production and for educational purposes during the production. This project does not, however, contain any artficiallly generated content other than code generated by a standard IDE autocomplete engine.*

## About

MiniFlow employs modular design to allow for intuitive building of a neural network from building blocks composed of layers, activations, loss functions, parameter optimizers, hyperparameter tuners and evaluation engines.

The base MiniFlowWorkbench class serves as an empty workbench ready to be supplied by a neural network itself and necessary machinery or "tools" for training and evaluation.

The goal of this project is to unify somewhat shattered theoretic nomenclature with OOP modular approach, choosing rigorous mathematical notation and focusing on reflecting natural mathematical flow in under-the-hood dataflow.
